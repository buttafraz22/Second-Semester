# Second-Semester
An overview of projects in second semester I've done.
This contains a basic overview of what I did in second semester.
OOP, EDP using C# and .NET Frameworks respectively.
I have made the code open source, so no worries from my side.
Although, take care to copy the code, as you might pay a hefty 
penalty in your institute for plagiarism.
